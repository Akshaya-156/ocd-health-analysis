# ocd-health-analysis
## Objective: The project focuses on analyzing data related to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) to understand patterns, trends, and correlations in patient demographics, treatment efficacy, and diagnosis outcomes.

## Data Sources: Data may be collected from clinical databases, surveys, electronic health records (EHRs), or research studies on OCD patients. It includes information like patient age, gender, diagnosis date, treatment types, and outcomes.
## SQL
### 1. Data Extraction: SQL queries are used to extract relevant data from clinical databases, such as patient records and treatment histories.
### 2. Data Cleaning: SQL helps in identifying and removing duplicates, handling missing data, and standardizing variables (e.g., categorizing age groups or treatment types).
### 3. Data Aggregation: SQL is utilized to group and summarize the data, such as calculating the average treatment duration for different patient demographics or determining the number of OCD cases per year.
### 4. Complex Queries: SQL can be employed for advanced analysis, such as finding correlations between treatment types and improvement rates or determining the recurrence rates among certain age groups.
## POWER BI for Visualization
### 1.Dashboards: Power BI is used to create interactive dashboards that provide insights into key metrics, such as patient demographics, treatment success rates, or OCD severity levels.
### 2. Trends and Comparisons: Visualizing trends over time (e.g., increase in OCD cases) or comparing outcomes across different patient demographics.
### 3. Interactive Reports: Power BI enables stakeholders to interact with the data, allowing them to filter results by region, age group, or treatment type to gain customized insights.
### Outcome: The project offers healthcare professionals and researchers a comprehensive understanding of OCD trends and treatment efficacy, aiding in decision-making and resource allocation
